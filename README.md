This is the official repo for FUSTT (Forecasting using Spatio-Temporal Transformer V1).

## Getting Started

1. Install Python >= 3.6, and install the dependencies by:

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. I suggest install python 3.7/3.8 which supports the other versions of software used as well. Once installed try to implement the models using the script running them on bash/cmd.

3. if using Linux, make the file executable by using chmod.
   and then run the script by
   bash .src/scripts/DiscoveryPassage_and_others_Script/FUSST.sh (make necessary changes)

TO RUN FUSTT, we use FUSST as the name for the code file (we called it fusst first, but then never changed the name in code file name again)

4. You can visualize the predictions of FUSTT through the notebook 'visualization.ipynb'.
